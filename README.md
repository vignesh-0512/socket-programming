 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple TCP/IP model using socket programming in Python. The model consists of a client and a server that communicate over a network.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- socket
- Git installed on your local machine.

 Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/vignesh-0512/socket-programming.git

Navigate to the project directory:
    cd socket-programming
  
    
Usage
To run this model, you need to open two terminals:
  
   Start the client:
    python client.py

  Start the server:
    python server.py
    

Once both the server and client are running, you can enter text in the client terminal. The text will be sent to the server.

Project Structure

client.py: Contains the client-side implementation.
server.py: Contains the server-side implementation.

 How It Works

1. The server listens for incoming connections from clients.
2. The client connects to the server and sends text input.
3. The server receives the text input and can process or display it.

This is a simple example that uses a client-server architecture with a command-line interface (CLI). Advanced features with a graphical user interface (GUI) will be published soon.
